# VulDection_LLM

## Description
Vul dection via LLM

## Installation
This project employs the CodeT5 open-source model, available on GitHub at:  
https://github.com/salesforce/CodeT5

To generate model evaluation reports correctly, you must configure a large language model API. Currently, only the DeepSeek API integration is implemented; support for additional model APIs will be introduced in future updates.

To execute the code:  
1. Replace the API key at approximately line 18 in `start_from_here.py` with a valid DeepSeek API key.  
2. Update the model path at line 26 to the actual directory location , for example `"D:\\Program\\CodeT5\\codet5"`.  

## Note 
~~Only the plagiarism detection feature is fully operational at this stage. Other functionalities are undergoing testing and will be progressively refined in subsequent releases.~~

All three main functions have been employed. If you do have better ideas or find bugs, please comment
The platform is undergoing previous updates, please wait and see.
